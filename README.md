HarfTeX
=======

HarfTeX is a TeX engine based on LuaTeX and aims to combine the flexibility of
LuaTeX with comprehensive support world languages and writing systems
more-or-less out of box (Ã  la XeTeX).

HarfTeX achieves this by including widely used text layout and font loading
libraries (such as [HarfBuzz][1] and ICU). That is while keeping the ability
for its users to replace the text layout engine.

Building
--------
